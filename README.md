#### Real data example
* *Rosenbaum2001.R* and *Rosenbaum2001.Rout*:

#### Monte-Carlo simulations
All of the programs below perform the same simulation for different data generating processes (DGPs) with different parameters. A sample of 1,000 units is drawn from a super-population 1,000 times for each parameter combination. For each sample, 1,000 different treatment assignment allocations are computed and the coverage and confidence/prediction intervals are calculated for each treatment assignment.

* *binary_outcome_sim.R* and *binary_outcome_sim.Rout*
* *tobit_outcome_sim.R* and *tobit_outcome_sim.Rout*:
