### Real data example

### Monte-Carlo simulations
All of the programs below perform the same simulation for different data generating processes (DGPs) with different parameters. A sample of 1,000 units is drawn from a super-population 1,000 times for each parameter combination. For each sample, 1,000 different treatment assignment allocations are computed and the coverage and confidence/prediction intervals are calculated for each treatment assignment.
